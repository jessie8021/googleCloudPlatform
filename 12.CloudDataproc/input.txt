In Spark, a DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into
named columns. Users cam use DataFrame API to perform various relational
perations on both external data sources and Spark's built-in distributed
collections without providing specific procedures for processing data. Also,
programs based on DataFrame API will be automatically optimized by Spark's
built-in optimizer, Catalyst.
